\section{Postscript}

If you want to show your appreciation to me for developing and sharing this material, there are three ways.

First, and most important, you can apply what you have learned as part of your own spiritual development. The Dhamma and the Abhidhamma are \textbf{not} meant for abstract theorizing; the Dhamma and the Abhidhamma are meant for practical application.

Second, you can email me (rob.abhidhamma@gmail.com) with questions regarding the material as I plan to add new items to the “Questions \& Answers” sections of the document from time to time.

Third, you can provide me with constructive criticism regarding the course. If there are mistakes I want to fix them immediately. If there are suggestions for improvement, I want to consider them for an updated version of the course. If there are differences of opinion, I want to listen because I have never learned anything from anybody who agreed with me.\footnote{\url{http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/d/dudleyfiel100695.html}}
