The eight lessons in this course cover selected topics from the Abhidhamma that are most practical and relevant to daily life. Though it is called a “Practical Abhidhamma Course,” it is also a practical Dhamma\footnote{In this context, “Dhamma” (\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma}) means both the Buddha’s teachings (capitalized “Dhamma”) and the Ultimate Realities of the Abhidhamma (lower case “dhamma”).} course using themes from the Abhidhamma.

The Dhamma and the Abhidhamma are \textbf{not} meant for abstract theorizing; they are meant for practical application. I hope you approach this course not only to learn new facts but also to consider how you can improve yourself spiritually.\footnote{The Commentary speaks of a progression: study (\textit{pariyatti}), practice (\textit{paṭipatti}) and realization (\textit{paṭivedha}).}

Ayyā Medhānandī Bhikkhunī suggested that I prepare this Practical Abhidhamma Course after a talk I gave at Sati Sārāṇīya Hermitage (\url{http://satisaraniya.ca/}). I am very grateful to the Venerables who reviewed the draft and corrected inaccuracies. Many of the questions came from my friends/students. Oli Cosgrove proofread the document and improved the writing style. My son Dion helped with aesthetics and all things digital (\LaTeX, Inkscape, and the website).
