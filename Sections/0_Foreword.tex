This course is for Theravāda\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theravada}} Buddhists with inquiring minds who want an introduction\footnote{Additional details can be found in the following texts (these texts are referenced in footnotes):\\

The recordings, handouts and the document can be downloaded from \url{http://practicalabhidhamma.com/}.

Some people may prefer listening to the recordings with the handouts in front of them.\footnote{When listening to the talks for the first time, you may have an impression of “information overload”, like trying to take a drink from a fire hose! \smiley \ If so, you may want to listen to the talks a second time or read the document.} Others may find they absorb more by reading the transcript of the talks in the document with the handouts in front of them. The document includes many diagrams and footnotes with links to online resources such as Suttas, stories from the Dhammapada Commentary and Wikipedia articles.\footnote{The footnotes are not merely an academic convention, they are my invitation to you to explore further. When viewing this document on a laptop or a tablet, the links are active; clicking a link shows the online website.} The document also includes Questions \& Answers for each talk. 

The talks cover selected topics from the Abhidhamma that are most practical and relevant to daily life. Though it is called a “Practical Abhidhamma Course,” it is also a practical Dhamma\footnote{In this context, “Dhamma” (\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma}) means both the Buddha’s teachings (capitalized “Dhamma”) and the Ultimate Realities of the Abhidhamma (lower case “dhamma”).} course using themes from the Abhidhamma.

The Dhamma and the Abhidhamma are \textbf{not} meant for abstract theorizing; the Dhamma and the Abhidhamma are meant for practical application. I hope you approach this course not only to learn new facts, but also to consider how you can improve yourself spiritually.\footnote{The Commentary speaks of a progression: study (\textit{pariyatti}), practice (\textit{paṭipatti}) and realization (\textit{paṭivedha}).}

\subsubsection*{Acknowledgements}

Ayyā Medhānandī Bhikkhunī suggested that I prepare this Practical Abhidhamma Course after a talk I gave at Sati Sārāṇīya Hermitage (\url{http://satisaraniya.ca/}). I am very grateful to the Venerables who reviewed the draft and corrected inaccuracies. Many of the questions came from my friends/students. Oli Cosgrove proofread the document and improved the writing style. My son Dion helped with aesthetics and all things digital (\LaTeX, audio and webpage).
