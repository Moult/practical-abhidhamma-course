This course is for Theravāda\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theravada}} Buddhists with inquiring minds who want an introduction\footnote{Additional details can be found in the following texts (these texts are referenced in footnotes):\\

The recordings, handouts and the document can be downloaded from \url{http://practicalabhidhamma.com/}.

Some people may prefer to listen to the recordings with the handouts in front of them\footnote{When listening to the talks for the first time, you may have an impression of “information overload”, like trying to take a drink from a fire hose! \smiley \  If so, you may want to listen to the talks a second time or read the document.}. Others may find they absorb more by reading the document\footnote{The pdf document can also be annotated so you can add your own notes.} with the handouts in front of them (the document includes a transcript of the talks). For those interested in a lot more information, the document includes footnotes\footnote{These footnotes are not merely an academic convention, they are my invitation to you to explore further.} and links\footnote{When viewing this document on a laptop or a tablet, the links are active; clicking on a link shows the referenced website.} to online resources such as Suttas, stories from the Dhammapada Commentary and Wikipedia articles. At the end of every section, the document includes a Question \& Answer portion. 

The talks will cover selected topics from the Abhidhamma that are most practical and relevant to daily life. Though it is called a “Practical Abhidhamma Course,” it is also a practical Dhamma\footnote{In this context, “Dhamma” (\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma}) means both the Buddha’s teachings (capitalized “Dhamma”) and the Ultimate Realities of the Abhidhamma (lower case “dhamma”).} course using themes from the Abhidhamma.

The Dhamma (and the Abhidhamma) is \textbf{not} meant for abstract theorizing; the Dhamma (and the Abhidhamma) is meant for practical application. I hope you approach this course not only to learn new facts, but also to consider how you can improve yourself spiritually.\footnote{The Commentary speaks of a three-step progression: study (\textit{pariyatti}), practice (\textit{paṭipatti}) and realization (\textit{paṭivedha}).}
